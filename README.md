# EDA
Codes and summaries of projects I've done regarding the application of Exploratory Data Analysis to business data:

A comprehensive EDA has been conducted on the sample data provided by an NYC-based food delivery company. Histograms, boxplots, barplots, 
as well as Python's data management libraries (numpy and pandas) have been used to demonstrate the efficacy and performance of the business
in a comprehensible fashion, and analyze important parameters such delivery time, cost, popular restaurants and cusines, customers'
satisfaction, etc. In the end, actionable recommendations have been presented.  

Both python codes (in .ipnyb format) and readable output (in .html format) have been provided.

Key tools: Python, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization.
Libraries: seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas
